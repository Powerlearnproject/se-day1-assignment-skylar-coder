Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering 

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is an application of principles of engineering to the development and maintenance of high quality softwares
Importance include
Helps in maintenance of softwares
helps to smooth run of softwares
helps one to understand and know how softwarres work

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
C programming
Python


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Design- This is where creation of the sortware architecture and user interface begins
Requirements - Process of gathering and documenting user needs and what system will require
Testing - This process ensures that the software has met its functional requirements
Implementation - Writing of codes is done here
Deployment- Releasing the software to the users
Maintenance - Updating, fixing bugs and upgrading is done here


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is linear and sequential meaning each phase is completed before the next phase and the phases include requirments, testing , deployment and maintenance while agile is iterative and incremental  meaning work is broken down to small increments 
    
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
responsibilities
Writing codes
work  on the design , implementation and testing of software solutions
Maintain codes
Role
They turn the requirements of a project to a functioning software

2) Quality Assurance Engineer
   Responsibility
   Test the software to ensure it meets quality standards
   Role
   Ensures that the final product is free from all defects

3) Project manager
   Responsibility
   Managing the entire software development project from start stage to the finale stage

   Role
   Ensures the project is completed on time


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs
Importance 
Provides an enviroment that simplifies the process of writing ,testing and debugging of codes eg Visual studio code
Role in development
Improves productivity by offering syntax highliting

VCS
Importance 
Manages the changes of source code over time allowing developers to track revision eg Git
Role in development
Enables collaboration among team members by handling code merging


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

problem Managing complex codes
solution use modular design principle

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - This is testing of individual components
importance - Ensures each part of the code works
System testing - Testing the complete and integrated software system to validate it aganist specified requirements
importance- Ensures that the entire system functions

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
